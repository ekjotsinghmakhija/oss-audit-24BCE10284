# Script 5: Open Source Manifesto Generator
# Author: Ekjot Singh | Roll: 24BCE10284
# Description: Interactively generates a personalised open-source
#              philosophy manifesto and saves it to a .txt file.
# Concepts: read (user input), string concatenation, > and >> redirection,
#           date command, alias declaration.

# --- Alias concept demonstration ---
# An alias maps a long command to a short, memorable label.
# This is defined in-script to demonstrate the concept.
# In a real shell session, aliases live in ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_aliases.
alias today='date "+%d %B %Y"'

# We can now call 'today' as if it were a built-in command:
# CURRENT=$(today)  -- this resolves to today's formatted date.
# For script compatibility we use the full date command below,
# but the alias above is a live, working declaration.

echo "I believe that software should empower rather than restrict. \
The tool I rely on daily, $TOOL, represents this philosophy perfectly. \
To me, open source is synonymous with $FREEDOM — it ensures that code \
remains a public good, not a locked box. Standing on the shoulders of \
the community, I pledge to build $BUILD and share it freely, so others \
may learn from my work just as I have learned from theirs." >> "$OUTPUT"
